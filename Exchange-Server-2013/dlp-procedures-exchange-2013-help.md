# DLP procedures

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_


You can begin using a data loss prevention (DLP) solution in your messaging environment by using the following procedures. To learn about concepts and objectives for DLP, see [Data loss prevention](technical-overview-of-dlp-data-loss-prevention-in-exchange.md).

[Create a DLP policy from a template](how-to-new-dlp-data-loss-prevention-policy-template.md)   Information to help you configure a Microsoft-supplied, pre-built set of policy rules. Policy templates are an easy way to get started with managing message data that is associated with several common legal and regulatory requirements.

[Create a custom DLP policy](create-a-custom-dlp-policy-exchange-2013-help.md)   Information to help you configure policy rules to meet the specific needs of your organization which may not be covered in one of the pre-existing DLP templates. The rule conditions that are available to you in a single policy include all the traditional transport rules in addition to the new sensitive information types.

[Import a custom DLP policy template from a file](import-a-custom-dlp-policy-template-from-a-file-exchange-2013-help.md)   Information to help you import a file that contains policy information settings. Policies that are created independent of Exchange as XML files must meet specific format requirements in order to work correctly.

[Manage DLP policies](manage-dlp-policies-exchange-2013-help.md)   Information to help you view, change, or remove existing data loss prevention policies.

[View DLP policy detection reports](view-dlp-policy-detection-reports-exchange-2013-help.md)   Track policy violations.


> [!NOTE]
> Data Loss Prevention is a premium feature that requires an Enterprise Client Access License (CAL).
