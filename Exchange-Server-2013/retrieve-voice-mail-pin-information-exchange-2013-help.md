# Retrieve voice mail PIN information

 

_**Applies to:** Exchange Online, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_


You can retrieve PIN information for a user who is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM). After a user has been enabled for UM-enabled and a PIN is generated or created, the PIN is encrypted and stored in the user's mailbox.

When you retrieve PIN information for a UM-enabled user, the information returned to you is calculated by using the encrypted PIN data stored in the user's mailbox. This lets you view information from the user's mailbox and also indicates whether the user has been locked out of the mailbox.

For additional tasks related to PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
