## What do you want to do?

## Use the EAC to wipe a user’s phone

You can use the EAC to wipe a user’s phone or cancel a remote wipe that has not yet completed.

1.  In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2.  Select the user, and under **Mobile Devices**, choose **View details**.

3.  On the **Mobile Device Details** page, select the lost mobile device, and then select **Wipe Data**.

4.  Select **Save**.

## Use the Shell to wipe a user’s phone

You can use the **Clear-MobileDevice** cmdlet in the Shell to wipe a user’s phone.

The following command wipes the device named WM\_TonySmith and sends a confirmation message to admin@contoso.com.

    Clear-MobileDevice -Identity WM_TonySmith -NotificationEmailAddresses "admin@contoso.com"

## Use Outlook Web App to wipe a user’s phone

Your users can wipe their own phone using Outlook Web App.

1.  In Outlook Web App, select **Settings \> Phone \> Mobile devices**.

## How do you know this worked?
